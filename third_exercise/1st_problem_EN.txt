Generate 100 random numbers with values in the range 1 to 500. As each number is generated, insert into an initially empty queue. If the number is two digits, it takes precedence over three digit numbers.

After inserting the 100 numbers, print in sequential order the positions in the queue where the number with the highest value and the number with the lowest value are found.
